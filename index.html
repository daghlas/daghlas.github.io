                        <p>Giving back is one of lives most important natures to live by. Having completed by degree program as a Software Engineer, I felt most obligated to immediately start puting my aquired skills to use while still awaiting to unfold my future opportunities, rolling stones gather no moss. As a HELB beneficiary, I couldn't possibly be thankful enough for all the times I was able get a helping hand from the prestigious organization and resultantly, it was my time to give back. I built the app MyHELB application, which is a fully functional prototype that emulates exactly how the whole funding and repayment process works. Working on this project broadened my programming knowledge and introduced me to an understanding of how <b>Fintech apps</b> work. I have been able to get an extensive understanding of financial apps such as banking applications and the various money lending apps. The source codes to this project is on private repository on my github due to confidentiality reasons but they can be availed on arrangement.

                        <p>Picture a world where all children are happily living with their families, or atleast being taken of by their sponsors or 
                        guardians. A community fully free from the influence of run away kids in the streets, where every young child is being brought 
                        up well and mentored on how to go about life before they can fully be dependant on themselves. It's beautiful isn't it? Not only do we take care of these kids current needs but also we see into it that their future and that of the community and the world as a whole is taken care of as they will be our leaders of tomorrow. MyRehab mobile application works to bring this imagination to embodiement, through the influence of <b>Wesley</b>, we collaborated to come up with a project that will work to see into it that our children are forever kept in safe hands. The application works in a manner that it liases with the available rehabilitation centers from the various regions, and the street children that do not have a home can be assigned to the available rehabs, and be adopted by a guardian or sponsor in the process who will work alongside with the responsilble rehab to see into it that these children's basic needs adequately are met.</p>

                        <p>Tax administration has always been a controversial topic of discussion across the various nations. As citizens we tend to express discontent with taxes due to the percieved reduction in our disposable income and the tangible impact on personal finances. However, taxes are indispensable for the functioning of a government, providing the necessary revenue to fund public services, infrastructure, and social programs. Despite our aversion to taxes, acknowledging our importance is crucial for sustaining a well-functioning society. During my time in KRA as an intern, I developed this MiniPRN application, a mobile app that helps streamline the tax collection process by reducing redundancies through incorporating of QR Codes on the payment slips and intergrated the app with the Lipa Na Mpesa API to prcoess all mpesa payments. This saves tax payers' time and effort during the process and clearings can be done much faster without any hiccups whatsoever due the streamlined process offered by this mobile application.</p>
